**Features:**

## Getting Started ⌨

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.<br>
See the **Deployment** section on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites ✏

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before preceding.
* Node & NPM

## Installation 💿

These are a series of step by step examples that will help you get a development environment up & running.

### Step 1. Download the zip or clone the repo 💾

```
git clone https://github.com/LijahTheDev/Wonderful-Quotes.git
```

### Step 2. Install Dependencies 🗂

Once you have the project folder ready to go, open the folder in your favorite code editor.<br>
Once you have opened the project folder in your code editor,<br> 
open the project directory in a terminal and run the following command in the project folder/directory.

```
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies and get all the required packages for this project.

### Step 3. Run Project on Local Dev Server 💻

Next, you'll want to run a local development server with hot reloading.<br> 
When you make changes and save, the server running the project on localhost will automatically reload with your changes.<br>
Vue makes it easy to spin up a local server on localhost by typing an easy command in the terminal.

```
npm run serve
```

## Deployment 📢
After following the previous installation steps up above,<br> 
you can run the following command to have an optimized production version of the project where you can put the project on a host of your choice.
```
npm run build
```
This command compiles and minifies the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>

See Vue's section about [deployment](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html) for more information.

### How I Handled Deployment 🔌

I used **Netlify** for deployment. It was one of the easiest things I did on this project.<br> 
I linked this repo to Netlify so anytime I push my changes to this repo it will automatically update the live website!<br>
